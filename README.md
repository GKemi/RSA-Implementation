# RSA-Implementation

## What is this program?
A program developed for my final year module "Computer Security," which simulates how an implementation of RSA would operate. When launched, it provides two scenarios of use:

  1. A basic RSA transaction
  2. Transaction failure
  
## Dependencies
To run this program, you will need to have Java SE Development Kit 8 installed onto your system.
  
## How to run the program
In order to run the program, you will need to download the contents of the repo and open terminal/command line. From there, navigate the present directory to the 'src' directory of the project. In this directory, simply use the following code:

```
javac *.java
```
To compile the program. Afterwards, execute the following to run the program:

```
